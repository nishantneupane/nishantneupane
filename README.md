## Hi there, I’m Nishant Neupane 👋

I’m a **Computer Science & Mathematical Economics** student at Gettysburg College  
(Aug 2022 – May 2026), passionate about building scalable full‑stack apps, data‑driven pipelines, and econometric research. I have always been fascinated by how computers have changed our lives and I hope to make a positive impact through the use of computers.
